# Modelling

Now we have the data but without a good technique to get value of it, data is only data. Here I present my idea of constructing a graph.

For this purpose, it is necessary to count some frecuencies and develop one strategy to transfor our .csv to a some kind of graph in order to work with the library Network X in Python.

When this task is preformed we can take a good insight of the data in an easy way making a community detection process and trying to search the most important airport with centrality measures.
